A very interesting phenomenon occurred to me. By writing a blog, or simply, by keeping a blog, one doesn't need to put words down but only holds the intention to do so; the mind connects more tangibly to the physical world. This connection manifests in several ways, brought out more visibly by this unusual time in our humanity. 

First of all, 8:00 AM on a Monday, I found myself in bed, alert, not comfortably but rather with a sense of urcertainty and excitement. I can think of no better words than "precarious". Precarious living. A word that sounds familiar yet tracing its origin risks diminishing the joy of having self-discovered this new method of being. 

More will come as the day progresses.
